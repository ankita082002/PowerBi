## 📌 Project Title

Spotify Listening Insights Dashboard

## 📝 Brief One Line Summary

A Power BI dashboard analyzing Spotify listening habits, behavioral patterns, and platform preferences.

## 🔎 Overview

This project explores music listening trends using Spotify data.
It provides insights into total songs played, unique tracks and artists, time-based listening patterns, platform preferences, and behavioral trends like skipping and shuffle usage.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Music streaming platforms generate massive data, but raw logs are hard to interpret.
This project aims to transform Spotify listening history into meaningful insights to understand:

* Listening patterns over time
* Artist and track preferences
* Behavioral aspects (skips, shuffle)
* Device/platform usage

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source**: Spotify data export (user listening history)
* **Tables Used**:

  * `Streaming History` – track-level listening logs
  * `App Usage / Platform Info` – device/platform details
  * `User Behavior Data` – skip, shuffle, play reasons

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

* **Power BI** – Dashboard & Visualization
* **CSV** – Data preprocessing
* **DAX** – Measures and Calculations

## ⚙️ Methods

* Data cleaning and transformation in Power Query
* DAX calculations for KPIs (songs played, unique artists, skip rate)
* Drillthrough and interactive filtering for deeper analysis
* Custom visualizations for listening patterns

## 📈 Key Insights

* 🎵 **16K total songs played** with **14K unique songs**
* 👩‍🎤 **4104 unique artists** explored
* ⏳ Listening time has steadily grown over the years, peaking around 2020
